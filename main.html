    <p>
        Cats have fewer cones than humans, so they see fewer colors. 
        A cat's vision is similar to that of a color blind person.
        They just may not see the “true” color of an object
        Cats can see shades of blue and green, but red and pink can be confusing.
        These might look greener, while purple might look like another blue.

    <h2>Do you know what does that mean they make trill or coo sound?</h2>
    <p>
        Dr. Phillips says: Cats usually trill, or coo like a pigeon, when they're happy and saying hello. 
        “Mom cats will also use this sound to get the attention of their kittens and trilling 
        is almost always a sign of a happy cat.” It's a sweet way to say hi.
